## Introduction
As a climber and regular user of [UKC](https://www.ukclimbing.com/), I frequently visit their [stats page](https://www.ukclimbing.com/logbook/showgraph.php?id=293254) to see how I have improved in my climbing over time. However the stats that this page provides are limited and with the amount of data held, the potential for much better insight into performance over time is apparent.

This project is a solution to that. By uploading your logbook (downloadable in DLOG .csv format) from UKC to this site, a better range of stats and graphs are shown to the user.

There is a [sample logbook](/Sample_Logbook_DLOG.csv) in this repo available for anyone to upload to the site to explore its capabilities.
